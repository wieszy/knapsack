<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p class="font-italic">

<strong>General information</strong> 
  You are about to take part in a decision-making experiment where the quality
  of your decisions can significantly impact your potential earnings. Throughout
  the experiment, all monetary values are expressed in Experimental Currency
  Units (ECU), which will be converted at a fixed exchange rate at the end of
  the experiment (see participant payout).<br/> 
  
  Rest assured that all your decisions
  and responses will be handled confidentially. Kindly review the following
  instructions attentively. Please complete the tasks individually to protect the validity of the results.</p>

<p><strong>Your task:</strong> 
  In the following, you will be presented with two blocks of three tasks each.
  Each task involves selecting a subset of projects while staying within a given
  budget. For each task, you will be given a list of projects, each with a
  specified value and cost. You can choose to include or exclude each project.
  Click on a project to include it in your selection. Click the item again to
  exclude it from your selection. Included items will be highlighted. Once you
  have made your selections, please click the "Next" button to submit your
  answers.
</p>

<p><strong>Impact on carbon mitigation funding:</strong> 
  In some tasks, these projects will have an impact on funding for climate change related projects (“value (climate)”). This impact can be both positive or negative. Positive amounts increase funding for carbon mitigation projects, negative amounts reduce funding for carbon mitigation projects. The initial amount of carbon mitigation funding (excluding the impact of your chosen
  project portfolio) will be stated on the decision screen. It is possible that
  the values of different projects will be all positive, all negative, or mixed.
  This is determined randomly by the software. </p>

<p>
  <strong>Participant payout:</strong> At the end of the experiment, one out of
  the six tasks is randomly chosen for payout. The cumulative value (self) from
  your selected projects will be converted from ECU to GBP at a fixed exchange
  rate of 25 ECU = 1 GBP. In the unlikely case that the resulting payout is less
  than 4 GBP, you still receive a minimum of 4 GBP.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Climate payout:</strong> If the randomly chosen task
  included an impact on carbon mitigation funding, the cumulative value (climate) from your chosen project portfolio will be converted from ECU to GBP at a fixed exchange rate of 25 ECU = 1 GBP as well and will best used to support "GROW MY TREE", an organization that plants trees to capture carbon from the atmosphere. 100 ECU correspond to roughly one planted tree. 
  A confirmation of payment will be sent to your Prolific inbox.
</p>

<h3>Please note:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Take your time to carefully consider each project and make the best decision
    based on your personal taste and the information provided.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are no right or wrong answers. We are interested in understanding
    your decision-making process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whether or not your paying round included a climate payment does not
    affect your expected payout.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for participating in our experiment!</p>
