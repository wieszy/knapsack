        <p>In this short experiment, you were randomly assigned to another participant. You and
the other person remain anonymous. All your decisions remain confidential.</p>

        <p> You'll make a total of six decisions in which you'll determine the distribution of points
between you and the other person. In each case, you'll have a choice between 10
different options, which differ in terms of the points that you and the other person will
each get. The options are as follows:</p>

        <table style="width:650px;" class="table">

            <tr style="border: 3px solid black;">
                <td>100</td>
                <td>98</td>
                <td>96</td>
                <td>94</td>
                <td>93</td>
                <td>91</td>
                <td>89</td>
                <td>87</td>
                <td>85</td>
                <th>For you</th>
            </tr>
            <tr style="border: 3px solid black;">
                <td>50</td>
                <td>54</td>
                <td>59</td>
                <td>63</td>
                <td>68</td>
                <td>72</td>
                <td>76</td>
                <td>81</td>
                <td>85</td>
                <th>For other person</th>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>In the experiment, there are checkboxes 1-9 below each of which you choose one. Your
payout depends on the points you collect yourself and the points the other person
assigns to you. Points are converted to GBP at a fixed rate of 1:1000.</p>
