{{ block title }} Task 3: Choosing projects (main task) {{ endblock }} {{ block content }}

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p class="font-italic">
  You are about to take part in a decision-making experiment where the quality
  of your decisions can significantly impact your potential earnings. Throughout
  the experiment, all monetary values are expressed in Experimental Currency
  Units (ECU), which will be converted at a fixed exchange rate at the end of
  the experiment (see experimental payout). Rest assured that all your decisions
  and responses will be handled confidentially. Kindly review the following
  instructions attentively, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to
  seek clarification. Please note that it is essential to turn off your cell
  phone during the experiment, and that communication with other participants is
  strictly prohibited.
</p>

<p>
  In the following, you will be presented with two blocks of three tasks each.
  Each task involves selecting a subset of projects while staying within a given
  budget. For each task, you will be given a list of projects, each with a
  specified value and cost. You can choose to include or exclude each project.
  Click on a project to include it in your selection. Click the item again to
  exclude it from your selection. Included items will be highlighted. Once you
  have made your selections, please click the "Next" button to submit your
  answers.
</p>

<p>
  In some tasks, these projects will have an impact on a charitable donation
  (“value (charity)”). This impact can be both positive or negative. Positive
  amounts increase the donation amount, negative amounts reduce the donation
  amount. The initial donation amount (excluding the impact of your chosen
  project portfolio) will be stated on the decision screen. It is possible that
  the values of different projects will be all positive, all negative, or mixed.
  This is determined randomly by the software. At the end of the experiment, the
  cumulative value to the charity associated with your selected projects will be
  donated to a charity of your choice (see charity payout).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Experimental Payout:</strong> At the end of the experiment, one out of
  the six tasks is randomly chosen for payout. The cumulative value (self) from
  your selected projects will be converted from ECU to Euro at a fixed exchange
  rate of 25 ECU = 1 €. In the unlikely case that the resulting payout is less
  than €4, you still receive a minimum of €4.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Charity Payout:</strong> Before the final results screen, you will be
  able to select a charity from a list of five charities, covering several areas
  (nature, animal welfare, children’s rights, etc.). If the randomly chosen task
  included a charitable donation, the cumulative value (charity) from your
  selected projects will be converted from ECU to Euro at a fixed exchange rate
  of 25 ECU = 1 € and donated to your chosen charity.
</p>

<h3>Please note:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Take your time to carefully consider each project and make the best decision
    based on the information provided.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is no right or wrong answer, and we are interested in understanding
    your decision-making process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whether or not your paying round included a charitable donation does not
    affect your expected payout.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have any questions or need clarification on any part of the
    instructions, please do not hesitate to ask.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for participating in our experiment!</p>
